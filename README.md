# ReflectBlock

This chrome extension blocks distracting sites, asking users to first write about what they could be doing instead, and who they could become if they did. The extension then asks if they still want to visit the site and for how long. The site is shut down after that specified amount of time.

Inspired by Jane McGonigal's The Willpower Instinct, my hope is that by first reflecting on the long term rewards of work, I'll be less likely to give in to the temptation of undue leisure. Of course, the software doesn't actually know if I'm answering the question, but it does block copy-and-pasted answers, and uses a crude algorithm to guess if I'm writing coherent English.
